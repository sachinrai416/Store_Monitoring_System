The code is for calculating the uptime and downtime for a given store over the last hour, day, and week. It takes the store's status data, business hours data,
and timezone data as inputs. The business hours data is used to determine the store's open and close times, and the timezone data is used to convert the timestamps 
in the status data to local time. The uptime and downtime are calculated by grouping the status data by date and then iterating over each date to calculate the time
the store was up and down for that day.

The function get_store_timezone(store_id, timezone_df) retrieves the timezone for a given store based on the store_id parameter and the timezone_df dataframe.
If no timezone is defined for the store, the function assumes it is in America/Chicago.

The function get_business_hours(store_id, status_df, timezone_df, business_hours_df) retrieves the business hours for a given store based on the store_id parameter
and the business_hours_df dataframe. It converts the timestamps in the status_df dataframe to local time using the store's timezone retrieved from the get_store_timezone function.

The function calculate_uptime_downtime(store_id, store_status_df, business_hours_df, store_timezone_df) calculates the uptime and downtime for a given store.
It uses the get_store_timezone and get_business_hours functions to retrieve the store's timezone and business hours data. It then groups the timestamps in the
store_status_df dataframe by date and stores them in a dictionary. It iterates over the dates in the dictionary to calculate the uptime and downtime for each day.
It determines the start and end times for each day based on the business hours data and then calculates the uptime and downtime for that day based on the timestamps
in the store_status_df dataframe. The calculate_uptime_downtime_for_stores function uses the calculate_uptime_downtime function to calculate the uptime and downtime
for the last hour, day, and week.

IMPROVEMENTS:

There are various ways to calculate the uptime and downtime for this store_monitoring problem. I am using the csv files directly to read and perform the necessary calculations. 
Database reading could have been better. Whatever, the result had a great time learning with python and django, Already fill much better command over python. Thanks a lot for this.

MUCH APPRECIATED!!!!
